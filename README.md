#### Other Variants
The only other variants on Lichess for which the initial position FEN is relevant are Horde and Racing Kings. Since they are the same for all games, they are omitted in the published minified csvs. However, for reference, they are as follows:
| Variant | FEN |
| --- | --- |
| Horde | rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/1PP2PP1/PPPPPPPP/PPPPPPPP/PPPPPPPP/PPPPPPPP w kq - 0 1 |
| Racing Kings | 8/8/8/8/8/8/krbnNBRK/qrbnNBRQ w - - 0 1 |


### Time Control
https://lichess.org/faq#time-controls
Lichess time controls are based on estimated game duration = (clock initial time) + 40 × (clock increment)
For instance, the estimated duration of a 5+3 game is 5 × 60 + 40 × 3 = 420 seconds.
< 29s = UltraBullet
< 179s = Bullet
< 479s = Blitz
< 1499s = Rapid
≥ 1500s = Classical

Correspondence games have their TimeControl tag value as "-".
